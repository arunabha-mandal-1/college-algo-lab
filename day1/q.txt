Write functions for bubble, selection, insertion sort. Analyze all algorithms for following conditions - 
    i.      For same i/p count number of comparisons
    ii.     For same i/p count number of swapping operations
    iii.    Display the content of the list after each pass during the sorting
    iv.     Major the execution time of each algorithms for different inputs
